Three-colour Roman Szmal watercolor palette suggested to me by [Carinya](https://plansoptional.com),
picked from the _"Urban Sketching"_ premade set I already own:
254 Ultramarine Intense + 252 Sap Green Light + 120 Italian Burnt Sienna.
_"Ultramarine and the burnt sienna will make really lovely gray tones
and you can warm them up or cool them down based on your mix.
Those three would be very similar to the three I like
\[DS Ultramarine Blue PB29, Green Gold PY 150+PY3+PG36, and Transparent Red Oxide PR101],
from what I can tell.
A true, vibrant blue + a reddish earth tone + a cool, very light green."_
