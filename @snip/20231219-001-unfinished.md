*"The poet Paul Valéry once said that poems are only abandoned, never finished.
I’m realizing that every project has a point where the creator, no matter how unsatisfied,
has to stop iterating and decide to put what they’ve made out into the world.
And it’s always a compromise, because they know every little flaw about the thing they’re making"*
