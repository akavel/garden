Basically, the advice boils down to buying a bunch of 9600lm (lm = lumen) LED lightbulbs,
or alternatively equivalent LED floodlights.
(Need to manage heating and power requirements, though.)
This then should hopefully improve both day-time energy and mood,
as well as feeling of drowsiness and sleepiness in the evening
(assuming overall light intensity is then globally reduced).
