# Brands of Discbound notebooks & accessories that I'm aware of

Warning: not 100% of those are 100% guaranteed to be 100% compatible.
Most of them should be, but there happen to be some outliers.
When trying to compare without buying,
first of all check **paper sizes**,
and the **number of discs** used along the spine.

## Assumed incompatible

**WARNING:** the brands on the list below either are, or seem,
**incompatible** with the original standard
as invented by Atoma founders.
You might still find them useful if you don't need compatibility.

- _Filofax Refillable Notebook - notably, the A5 size (only!) is borderline compatible: the wires are slightly off, but elastic enough that they can bend a bit, such that they can accept discbound-punched A5 paper ([via](https://youtu.be/s7sdfPmS2GY?feature=shared&t=845)); the fit is not perfect and paper has a tendency to slip off, but it kinda works; on A4 the size differences are reportedly too big, while the "pocket" reportedly has a weird, nonstandard paper size._
- _[The Jotting Dots](https://thejottingdots.com/collections/discbound-notebook) (India) - [reported incompatible](https://old.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/187c7qm/discbound_notebook/kbe79cr/), visual inspection of their photos seems to confirm._
