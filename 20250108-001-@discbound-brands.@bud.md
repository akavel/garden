When trying to compare without buying,
first of all check **paper sizes**,
and the **number of discs** used along the spine.

**WARNING:** the brands on the list below either are, or seem,
**incompatible** with the original standard
as invented by Atoma founders.
You might still find them useful if you don't need compatibility.
