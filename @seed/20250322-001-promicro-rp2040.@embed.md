# Running Rust "blinky" on _Sparkfun Pro Micro RP2040_

This is surprisingly involved.
My main point of confusion seemed to result from the fact,
that _**there is no simple LED diode on [the board](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro-rp2040-hookup-guide/all)**_.
So, you _cannot_ just do the usual "blinky" dance,
that is setting a pin "high" and then setting it "low".

Instead, **pin 25** is connected to a **multicolor, RGB light**,
also known as a **"Pixel"**, or technically as **WS2812**.
It will _not_ work when just set to high level. Unfortunately.

But, with Rust, we can have it work quite easily!

**tl;dr:** clone [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy);
modify [`examples/rp/src/bin/pio_ws2812.rs`](
https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/main/examples/rp/src/bin/pio_ws2812.rs)
to change
[`PIN_16` in `PioWs2812` constructor](
https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/4033a619a87da733e2087bb7a2eb92017b33a9c5/examples/rp/src/bin/pio_ws2812.rs#L52)
to `PIN_25`;
hold _[Boot Button](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro-rp2040-hookup-guide/all#:~:text=Boot%20Button)_
and press _[Reset Button](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro-rp2040-hookup-guide/all#:~:text=Reset%20Button,-as%20explained)_;
run `cargo run --bin pio_ws2812`.
