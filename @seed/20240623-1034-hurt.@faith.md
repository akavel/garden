# Hurt

[[TODO]]: disclaimer - not necessarily official teaching of the Church; personal exploration/intuition at my current place on spiritual path

I got a thought today
during an ignatian examen,
that when people hurt me,
maybe sometimes this is their way
of trying to tell me
they want me to give them love.
A stupid way, but still.

I then tried to rotate this idea,
and thus thought,
that when I sin,
maybe this is my way
of trying to tell God
that I want Him to give me love.
A stupid way, but still.
And maybe He understood it when he accepted the Cross.
Because I assume He never hurts us to tell us He wants our love,
I allow myself to assume He knows it is stupid.

Finally,
when I hurt, abuse, sin against myself,
maybe this is my way
of trying to tell myself
that I want me to give me love.
