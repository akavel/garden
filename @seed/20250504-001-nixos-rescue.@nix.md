# NixOS rescue

I managed to rescue my existing NixOS installation on a dual-boot Asus laptop with Windows,
using a _Sandisk MobileMate_ SD-card reader and a 4GB microSD card.

I flashed the NixOS graphical .iso image on the microSD card
using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/).
Then, after inserting it in the _MobileMate_
into the USB drive of the Asus laptop,
I booted it and immediately pressed F2.
This allowed me to enter BIOS,
and it then showed a Boot option for the _Sandisk_ device.
I had to reboot the machine manually once again,
but then it showed NixOS.

In NixOS,
I opened a terminal window
and did the following steps:
 1. `sudo su -`
 2. `fdisk -l` to find the EFI partition ([via](https://old.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/10nodhv/repair_rebuild_nixos_with_live_cd_usb/kznnvdb/))
 3. `mkdir -p /mnt/boot ; mount /dev/$THE_EFI_PARTITION /mnt/boot`
 4. `mv /mnt/boot/EFI/Microsoft{,.bak}` ([via](https://old.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/10nodhv/repair_rebuild_nixos_with_live_cd_usb/j6fzc59/?context=3))
 5. Reboot
 6. NixOS image choice GRUB menu should show up - pick as appropriate.
 7. In NixOS, assuming `/dev/$THE_EFI_PARTITION` is mounted at `/boot`,
    revert back the EFI contents: `sudo mv /boot/EFI/Microsoft{.bak,}`
 9. Shutdown, then boot again, but _hold F2 pressed_ when booting.
 10. In BIOS, adjust the boot order, to put "EFI Partition..." first
     (this is the NixOS).
