# First assembly on nRF51822 microcontroller

I'm having [a lot of weird problems](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/discussions/3175#discussioncomment-12595670)
trying to put Rust programs on an nRF51822 microcontroller,
and to have them run correctly.
I decided I need to try going low level to assembly,
and debugging instruction by instruction.
Going down to "first principles".

I found [a great blog series][sven0]
on writing very simple Cortex-M assembly.
It's written for a Cortex-M4 processor,
but it feels it should not need much adjustment to make it work for a Cortex-M0 one I have.

[sven0]: https://svenssonjoel.github.io/pages-2021/cortex-m-assembler-0/index.html

## The code

Trying [to use](https://github.com/akavel/nrf51822-asm-debugging/blob/a74d9954308432a06e819088e43b513c93c9b7ec/try01/try.s)
the code verbatim from
the [first part of the series][sven0]
resulted in a bunch of errors like below:

```
C:> arm-none-eabi-as -g -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb try.s -o try.o
try.s: Assembler messages:
try.s:26: Error: cannot honor width suffix -- `sub r2,r1,r0'
try.s:34: Error: lo register required -- `add r1,r1,#1'
try.s:35: Error: lo register required -- `add r0,r0,#1'
try.s:37: Error: lo register required -- `sub r2,r2,#1'
try.s:43: Error: cannot honor width suffix -- `ldr r9,=apa'
try.s:44: Error: cannot honor width suffix -- `ldr r9,[r9]'
try.s:47: Error: cannot honor width suffix -- `ldr r8,=0x1337BEEF'
```

After some searching, it seems that
some commands need to be
marked with explicit clarification
that they change the flags registers,
which is done by adding a `s` suffix.
Thus, `sub` needs to become `subs`,
and `add` become `adds`.

Also, on Cortex-M0 (a.k.a. ARMv6-M),
`ldr` can only access registers up to `r7`,
so I needed to tweak those commands
to use lower registers instead of `r8` and `r9`.

Taking into account also some improvements
that were done in subsequent articles in the series,
my code became:

```armasm
	.syntax unified
	.cpu cortex-m0
	.thumb

	.global vtable
	.global reset_handler

	.section .text

vtable:
	.word _estack
	.word reset_handler
	.word 0
	.word hardfault_handler
	@ .size vtable, .-vtable

.thumb_func	
hardfault_handler:
	b hardfault_handler
	
.thumb_func	
reset_handler:
	ldr r0, =_estack
	mov sp, r0

	ldr r0, =_dstart
	ldr r1, =_dend

	subs r2,r1,r0

	ldr r1, =_flash_dstart

cpy_loop:
	ldrb r3, [r1]
	strb r3, [r0]

	adds r1, r1, #1
	adds r0, r0, #1

	subs r2, r2, #1
	cmp r2, #0
	bne cpy_loop


main:
	ldr r4, =apa
	ldr r4, [r4]

	ldr r5, =0xF00DF00D
	ldr r6, =0x1337BEEF

done:
	b done

	.section .data

apa:	.word 0xFEEBDAED
```

The linker script also needed to be changed,
I based it on the one used e.g. [in `embassy-nrf`](
https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/f15a11f4d69ea905e9feb944969f6b1d1f134e63/examples/nrf51/memory.x):

```
_estack = 0x20010000;

MEMORY
{
FLASH (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 256K
RAM (xrw)   : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 16K
}


SECTIONS
{

.text : {
      *(.text)
}>FLASH

_flash_dstart = .;

.data :  {
      _dstart = .;
      *(.data)
      _dend = .;
}>RAM AT> FLASH  /* Load into FLASH, but live in RAM */


} /* SECTIONS END */
```

(I might actually have done stack bad;
given the smaller RAM,
I'm now pretty sure I need to move it back a tad.
But I'm not actually using it yet,
so I didn't have a chance to be hit by it...)

## Flashing

I built and flashed it with:
```
C:> arm-none-eabi-as -g -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb try.s -o try.o
C:> arm-none-eabi-ld try.o -T ./try.ld -o try.elf

C:> openocd -f openocd.cfg

## Live debugging

Now the fun part:
connecting to the chip remotely
and watching live code with a debugger!
With openocd, this seems to need running two terminal windows.
One of them hosts openocd,
which then opens a TCP port for gdb to connect to:

```
C:> openocd -f openocd.cfg

```

In the next window, can now start gdb:
```
C:> arm-none-eabi-gdb

(gdb)
```

The first command to enter in gdb, at the `(gdb)` prompt,
is to connect to the openocd server:
```
(gdb) target remote :3333
Remote debugging using :3333
0xfffffffe in ?? ()
```

To see the contents of the registers, we can now run `i r`:
```
(gdb) i r
r0             0x20000004       536870916
r1             0x58     88
r2             0x0      0
r3             0xfe     254
r4             0xfeebdaed       -18097427
r5             0xf00df00d       -267522035
r6             0x1337beef       322420463
r7             0xffffffff       -1
r8             0xffffffff       -1
r9             0xffffffff       -1
r10            0xffffffff       -1
r11            0xffffffff       -1
r12            0xffffffff       -1
sp             0x20010000       0x20010000
lr             0xffffffff       -1
pc             0x34     0x34
xPSR           0x61000000       1627389952
```

And indeed, they contain the expected contents!
- `r4`: `0xfeebdaed`
- `r5`: `0xf00df00d`
- `r6`: `0x1337beef`
- `sp`: `0x20010000` (buggy)
- `pc`: `0x34` - which is the address of the infinite loop at the end of our program,
  as can be seen in:

```
C:> arm-none-eabi-objdump -s -d try.elf
...
0000002c <main>:
  2c:   4c06            ldr     r4, [pc, #24]   ; (48 <done+0x14>)
  2e:   6824            ldr     r4, [r4, #0]
  30:   4d06            ldr     r5, [pc, #24]   ; (4c <done+0x18>)
  32:   4e07            ldr     r6, [pc, #28]   ; (50 <done+0x1c>)

00000034 <done>:
  34:   e7fe            b.n     34 <done>
...
```

I was however also interested
if I could _step_ through the program,
from its start -
not just observe the state
at the end of the execution of the code.
This led me to [another hint](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47599728/98528)
on a "magic" trick how to do a "soft reset" on an ARM chip:
```
(gdb)  monit reset halt
[nrf51.cpu] halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread
xPSR: 0xc1000000 pc: 0x00000012 msp: 0x20010000
(gdb) set {unsigned int}0xe000ed0c = 0x05fa0004
```
After executing this, the registers are now zeroed out:
```
(gdb) i r
r0             0xffffffff       -1
r1             0xffffffff       -1
r2             0xffffffff       -1
r3             0xffffffff       -1
r4             0xffffffff       -1
r5             0xffffffff       -1
r6             0xffffffff       -1
r7             0xffffffff       -1
r8             0xffffffff       -1
r9             0xffffffff       -1
r10            0xffffffff       -1
r11            0xffffffff       -1
r12            0xffffffff       -1
sp             0x20010000       0x20010000
lr             0xffffffff       -1
pc             0x12     0x12
xPSR           0xc1000000       -1056964608
```
and as we can see, the `pc` is at `0x12`,
which is the beginning of our `reset_handler` function:
```
C:> arm-none-eabi-objdump -s -d try.elf
...
00000012 <reset_handler>:
  12:   4809            ldr     r0, [pc, #36]   ; (38 <done+0x4>)
  14:   4685            mov     sp, r0
...
```
