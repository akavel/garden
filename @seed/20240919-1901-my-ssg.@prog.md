# My SSG

In _my_ SSG, I don't use frontmatter [indeed][lob], and have the files content be just normal markdown. And I keep my metadata (date and tags) **in the filename**, as:

`<DATE_ISO>-title-slug.<@TAGS>.md`

e.g.:

[`20240611-1826-forge-horizons.@review.@ironsworn.@bud.md`](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/main/20240611-1826-forge-horizons.%40review.%40ironsworn.%40bud.md)

which, when rendered, is then [stripped](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/ca2404f15b518ae432a4ef31774a7d48d189a43b/_rendr/pathinfo.rs#L85-L128) down just [to](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/ca2404f15b518ae432a4ef31774a7d48d189a43b/_bloat/bloat.lua#L197) the `title-slug` part, whereas `<DATE_ISO>` and `<@TAGS>` are extracted, for a timestamp and a tags list respectively:

https://akavel.com/forge-horizons

Also, I stole the core idea of the rest of the SSG from the [Soupault SSG](https://soupault.app): I don't use an ([increasingly complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule)) templating language; instead, I render the Markdown [to](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/ca2404f15b518ae432a4ef31774a7d48d189a43b/_rendr/main.rs#L94-L97) HTML, then use Lua+Rust to further operate _on HTML_, mashing together pure HTML [page](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/main/_bloat/bloat.html) [templates](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/main/_bloat/index.html) with the rendered [HTML](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/ca2404f15b518ae432a4ef31774a7d48d189a43b/_bloat/bloat.lua#L24) of the Markdown contents. Because [Lua is Greenspun's Tenth Rule embraced and accepted](https://www.lua.org/history.html).

Is the HTML-manipulating code readable? [Nope, sorry.](https://github.com/akavel/garden/blob/main/_bloat/bloat.lua) I wish it was. But at least it is relatively small, and the inputs are understandable to me, while in most SSGs I found, the DSL and conventions were always confusing and convoluted to me.
