# Do not return err in Go

Instead, **add missing details relevant for debugging.**

People who don't understand Go errors
like to complain that the language requires writing
tons of "`if err != nil { return err }`" blocks.
Problem is, this is a completely wrong way of error handling in Go; an *antipattern*.

Let's show what I mean on some sample code:
a helper library for configuring an [mTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mTLS#mTLS) connection.
("Mutual TLS" is a way to prove to a server that a client is who they claim to be.)

```golang
package mtls

import (
	"crypto/tls"
	"fmt"
)

type ClientConfig struct {
	CAPath   string
	KeyPath  string
	CertPath string
}

func (c *ClientConfig) NewTLSConfig() (*tls.Config, error) {
}
```
