# The missing guide to errors in Go

Among people writing in the Go programming language,
it is a common complaint to claim that the language needs sprinkling the codebase with 
"`if err != nil { return err }`" blocks.
As far as I understand the intention of the authors of the Go language,
this is a misguided conclusion.
Even more than that—to my understanding, 
such blocks are in fact an antipattern.

Go is indeed constructed in a way that generally makes it necessary
to write "`if err != nil`" _conditionals_, this part is true.
But the subtle—yet extremely important—difference is in how the
_body_ of those blocks is intended to look.
Their whole purpose is to make it as easy as possible
for a deliberate Go programmer to
**add valuable context to error messages**.

In shortest words, an ideal, idiomatic block of error-passing Go code could be summarized as:

```go
if err != nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("<uniquely local context>: %w", err)
}
```
