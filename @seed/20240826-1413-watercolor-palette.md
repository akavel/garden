# Watercolor palette (for a beginner)

Presumably up to 12 colors.

Question: should it be a "CMY/K" based palette?
and/or, should it be "warm+cool primary colors" a.k.a. "split primary triad"?
should it be "pure pigments"?

I was initially recommended the _Walter & Newton (Cotman)_ brand
as a cheaper alternative to _Schmincke (Akademie)_.
Since then, I found out that the _Roman Szmal_ brand
(hereafter shortened to _RS_)
seems also highly regarded,
and actually of better quality (comparable to pro W&N / Schmincke grades paints)
while _much cheaper_ than those intial ones
(at least in my home country of Poland,
where _Roman Szmal_ is based).
The _RS_ paints seem to focus on pure pigments.
I also found that the _Renesans_ brand
seems based in Poland too and even slightly cheaper,
while also a serious one,
but I haven't watched any reviews yet.

There isn't very much _RS_ content on youtube yet;
[one video](https://youtu.be/zCU8yMuuAqo?t=1208)
seems to build up a purely-_RS_ "beginner" palette,
though I'm not super sure how much it is universal vs.
tailored at the specific person composing it.
The components seem to be:
