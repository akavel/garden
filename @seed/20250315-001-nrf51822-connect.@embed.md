# nRF51822 (Core51822) - first connection on Windows

[Core51822](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Core51822)
is a cheap Chinese electronics module
(printed circuit board with components)
with a Bluetooth Low-Energy enabled ARM Cortex-M0 chip
NRF51822 (from Nordic Semiconductor).

For connecting, I used an also cheap 
"ST-Link v2" clone "pendrive" programmer.

## Wiring

As found on some tutorial, for connecting the board to the programmer,
the following pins should be wired together:

```
Core51822 <-> ST-Link/v2
------------------------
      GND <-> GND
      VDD <-> 3.3V
     SCLK <-> SWCLK
      SDO <-> SWDIO
```

A quick rough image (pin locations on the programmer differ in mine):

## ST-Link USB driver

First, I had to install STLink from STMicroelectronics website.
It seemed to require giving them my email even when I clicked "Download as a guest".
I got the whole "STLink tool" but it should be enough to get just the USB driver at:
https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html

I tried using the open-source alternative (?): https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink
but it didn't seem to work for me. (Maybe I should also install a USB driver they mention somewhere in the docs?)

## probe-rs

Next, I installed probe-rs: https://probe.rs

## First try running probe-rs

Running probe-rs 0.27, I got the following output:

```
c:> probe-rs info
Probing target via JTAG

←[33m WARN←[0m ←[2mprobe_rs::probe::stlink←[0m←[2m:←[0m send_jtag_command 242 failed: JtagUnknownJtagChain
Error identifying target using protocol JTAG: An error with the usage of the probe occurred

Probing target via SWD

ARM Chip with debug port Default:
Debug Port: DPv1, MINDP, DP Designer: ARM Ltd
└── 0 MemoryAP (AmbaAhb3)
    └── Error during access: The debug probe encountered an error.


Debugging RISC-V targets over SWD is not supported. For these targets, JTAG is the only supported protocol. RISC-V specific information cannot be printed.
Debugging Xtensa targets over SWD is not supported. For these targets, JTAG is the only supported protocol. Xtensa specific information cannot be printed.
```

This was not super encouraging (noting the "error"),
but still somewhat so:
it seemed to correctly detect that it's some kind of an ARM Chip.

## Second try via openocd

I then also tried installing openocd (from github releases),
version 0.12.0.

I wrote the following file `openocd.cfg`
([via](https://gist.github.com/robot9706/9119d26fa860a257c8db8f5fb25573e8)):

```
source [find interface/stlink-v2.cfg]
transport select hla_swd
set WORKAREASIZE 0x4000
source [find target/nrf51.cfg]
```

Then, in one cmd window, run:

```
c:> openocd.exe -f openocd.cfg

Info : Listening on port 3333 for gdb connections

```

This again seemed to correctly detect an ARM chip,
this time with some more details (Cortex-M0) -
though I'm not super sure if that's "detected"
or rather just known because `nrf51.cfg`
was explicitly listed in the `openocd.cfg` file...

The following command stops and waits for connections,
so I needed to open another cmd window.
The OpenOCD server can take telnet connections,
so I installed telnet first with:

```
c:> pkgmgr /iu:"TelnetClient"

c:> telnet localhost 4444
```

**Note:** if too much time passed,
commands may error out,
and restarting `openocd` may be needed -
I got errors like below first when trying to run some commands:

```
Info : Halt timed out, wake up GDB.
Error: timed out while waiting for target halted
```

After restarting, telnet worked again and my session looked like below
([via](https://gist.github.com/robot9706/9119d26fa860a257c8db8f5fb25573e8)):

```
Open On-Chip Debugger

> reset
```

This seemed to detect for me that I got a QFAA version of the chip in the module,
that is a version with 256kB Flash and 16kB RAM (as also printed).

For completeness, the output in the openocd window looked like below after the full telnet session above:
