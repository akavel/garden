# Notes on playing *Ironsworn: Starforged* co-op

**Shared Iron Vows.** The *Swear an Iron Vow* Move can be used to swear a shared vow.
The vow does not have to be equally exciting for both Players,
["they might also be something that one is committed to, with other PCs agreeing to help them in that quest."](
https://old.reddit.com/r/Ironsworn/comments/1n6n5lm/confused_around_inventing_shared_vows_in_coop/nc30ycw/)
In a shared vow, *one* Player makes the initial Move,
but both Players share the Progress Tracker,
and both Players gain XP (if any) when the vow is *Fulfilled*.

**Combat.** The Players share a common, single Progress Tracker,
but they make the *Enter the Fray* Move ***separately***.
This is so that each Player will separately track if they're
*In Control*, or *In a Bad Spot*.

**Session 0: Character Questions.**
Consider using the third-party addon
["Ironsworn: Starforged Character Creation Questions"](
https://gorgonhead.itch.io/starforgedcharactercreationquestions),
by Jozef Frajkor.
This can help give some initial link,
or a glimpse of some shared history,
for the characters in the game.

**Session 1: Initial Shared Vow.**
To quickly introduce the Players to how the Iron Vows work,
consider explicitly discussing with everyone out-of-character
what initial shared vow could the team swear.
Try to do it early, or at least discuss it early,
right after introducing the initial drama,
a.k.a. the inciting incident.

**Connections.**
According to the Rulebook (pg. 162),
_"a connection can be shared--in which case you track progress on that connection together."_

**Interpretation Disagreements.**
It's a good idea to propose
that in case of different views
on interpreting the result of a roll or an oracle,
in general the Player making the roll has the final say.
(As long as it does not affect the other Player's character
in a way they don't like, etc.)
