# Nokia 5110 LCD module

I tried running the module
from a Sparkfun _Pro Micro RP2040_ board.

## Rust try 1 & 2: fail

I failed to get it to run under [embassy](https://embassy.dev)
both with [pcd8544](https://docs.rs/pcd8544/)
and [github.com/tib888/lcd-hal](https://github.com/tib888/lcd-hal).

## micropython-pcd8544: success!

### Step 1: wiring

The connections I needed to make between the boards:
```
  5110 | ProMicro RP2040
-------+----------------
1 RST    pin 6
2 CE     pin 5
3 DC     pin 4
4 Din    CO      (SPI = PICO Peripheral-In/Controller-Out = MOSI Master-Out/Slave-In
5 Clk    SCK     (SCLK = Serial CLocK)
7 BL     pin 7
```
Plus, obviously, power and ground:
```
  5110 | ProMicro RP2040
-------+----------------
6 Vcc    3V3
8 Gnd    GND
```

### Step 2: MicroPython on SparkFun RP2040

Download: [MicroPython for SparkFun Pro Micro, v1.24.1 (2024.11.29).uf2](
https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/SPARKFUN_PROMICRO-20241129-v1.24.1.uf2).

On the ProMicro,
when connected to an USB port on the computer,
*hold* the "BOOT" button
(the one on the side with pins TX, RX, and numbers 2-6),
and *while holding* it,
*press and release* the "RESET" button
(the one on the side with pins CI, SCK, and notably RST).

This should result in a new "disk" showing up in the Windows PC.
Just *drag & drop* the micropython `SPARKFUN_PROMICRO-20241129-v1.24.1.uf2` file
onto this new pseudo-disk.
The disk should disappear after the copy completes,
and a sound of USB device disconnecting should happen.
A new notification may show up about installing a new USB device.
