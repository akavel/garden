# Nokia 5110 LCD module

I tried running the module
from a Sparkfun _Pro Micro RP2040_ board.

## Rust try 1 & 2: fail

I failed to get it to run under [embassy](https://embassy.dev)
both with [pcd8544](https://docs.rs/pcd8544/)
and [github.com/tib888/lcd-hal](https://github.com/tib888/lcd-hal).

## micropython-pcd8544: success!

### Step 1: wiring

The connections I needed to make between the boards:
```
  5110 | ProMicro RP2040
-------+----------------
1 RST    pin 6
2 CE     pin 5
3 DC     pin 4
4 Din    CO      (SPI = PICO Peripheral-In/Controller-Out = MOSI Master-Out/Slave-In
5 Clk    SCK     (SCLK = Serial CLocK)
7 BL     pin 7
```
Plus, obviously, power and ground:
```
  5110 | ProMicro RP2040
-------+----------------
6 Vcc    3V3
8 Gnd    GND
```

### Step 2: MicroPython on SparkFun RP2040

Download: [MicroPython for SparkFun Pro Micro, v1.24.1 (2024.11.29).uf2](
https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/SPARKFUN_PROMICRO-20241129-v1.24.1.uf2).

On the ProMicro,
when connected to an USB port on the computer,
*hold* the "BOOT" button
(the one on the side with pins TX, RX, and numbers 2-6),
and *while holding* it,
*press and release* the "RESET" button
(the one on the side with pins CI, SCK, and notably RST).

This should result in a new "disk" showing up in the Windows PC.
Just *drag & drop* the micropython `SPARKFUN_PROMICRO-20241129-v1.24.1.uf2` file
onto this new pseudo-disk.
The disk should disappear after the copy completes,
and a sound of USB device disconnecting should happen.
A new notification may show up about installing a new USB device.

### Step 3: test connection with PuTTy

In Windows _Device Manager_,
find a "USB Serial Device (COM3)" or similar.
The "(COM3)" part (in my case "(COM6)") will be important here.

For details, see [the excellent guide at picockpit.com](
https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-pico-and-micropython-on-windows/#:~:text=Connecting%20to%20the%20Pico).

In PuTTy, open a "Serial" connection to the port found above
(it might be COM3, or COM6, or some other similar number).

You should see a text like:
```
MicroPython v1.24.1 on 2024-11-29; SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 with RP2040
Type "help()" for more information.
>>>
```

You should be able to type simple Python commands:
```
MicroPython v1.24.1 on 2024-11-29; SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 with RP2040
Type "help()" for more information.
>>> print("hello rpi2040!")
hello rpi2040!
>>>
```

### Step 4: Download and install Thonny

Thonny seems to be a simple Python IDE with support for MicroPython and RP2040.

Again, follow the [excellent guide at picockpit.com](
https://picockpit.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-pico-and-micropython-on-windows/#:~:text=Thonny:%20a%20Python%20IDE).
Note though, that **the "blinky" example will not work.**
The ProMicro RP2040 board has no normal, simple LED,
but instead has a complex "NeoPixel" multi-color LED,
which means it is super-complicated to program
and it's not easy to just test if a blinky works on this board :(
But you already tested micropython, so you know it works!

In Thonny,
paste the 
[pcd8544.py file from gh/mcauser/micropython-pcd8544 repo](
https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-pcd8544/blob/791d4239d77b0d06192c7ab7903d81a72a53f992/pcd8544.py).
When saving the file,
save it to Raspberry Pi,
giving the name: `pcd8544.py`.

Create new file,
and now paste:

```python
# From: https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-pcd8544

import pcd8544
from machine import Pin, SPI

# Connections:
#  5110 | ProMicro RP2040
# ------+----------------
#  RST    pin 6
#  CE     pin 5
#  DC     pin 4
#  Din    CO      (SPI = PICO Peripheral-In/Controller-Out = MOSI Master-Out/Slave-In
#  Clk    SCK     (SCLK = Serial CLocK)
#  BL     pin 7

spi = SPI(0)
spi.init(baudrate=2000000, polarity=0, phase=0)
cs = Pin(5) # a.k.a. CE
dc = Pin(4)
rst = Pin(6)

# backlight on
bl = Pin(7, Pin.OUT, value=1)

lcd = pcd8544.PCD8544(spi, cs, dc, rst)

# bitmap smiley (horzontal msb)
lcd.clear()
# draw 8x16 in bank 0 (rows 0..7)
lcd.position(0, 0)
lcd.data(bytearray(b'\xE0\x38\xE4\x22\xA2\xE1\xE1\x61\xE1\x21\xA2\xE2\xE4\x38\xE0\x00'))
# draw 8x16 in bank 1 (rows 8..15)
lcd.position(0, 1)
lcd.data(bytearray(b'\x03\x0C\x10\x21\x21\x41\x48\x48\x48\x49\x25\x21\x10\x0C\x03\x00'))
```

Click "Run". You should see a lovely smiley in a corner of the LCD screen!
