# Q: How to simplify in watercolors?

A question I asked [in a comment on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlklt4dw6GA&lc=UgyvD2e_1YymuFuteJB4AaABAg):

> As a complete beginner to watercolors (just did my first painting attempt yesterday), 
do you have some hints or guide on how to simplify things? 
This is the one aspect that I seem to be really struggling with: 
how can I reduce detail? 
It feels to me that if I skip some element, 
it will be cheating and not the real painting of what I tried to paint - 
but even if I get myself to do the decision, 
I'm then left confused what to fill the space with where the thing was... 
sometimes it can be just the sky, but not always -
if it is a bunch of trees or buildings, they can have quite complex features/lines... 
and again, e.g. for buildings I'm frustrated with how to reduce their complexity 
while keeping their character, or how to call it... 
for sky/trees, it seems to be simpler with watercolor, as the paint naturally forms "organic" patterns of texture, 
but buildings tend to have lots of sharp features - how to simplify them?...

Some notes based on some [videos by Matthew White](
https://www.youtube.com/@learntopaintwatercolor/videos):
 - squint and look for large shapes ([via](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB6jb5Sgjis));
   see little shapes in more of a connected way
 - imply detail (...how?) 
 - TODO: value study, "mid-tones shape" - exercises how to study?
   - "large, connected shape of middle values"
   - look at the photo/image in black & white
  
 A ["How to Simplify (...)" video by Ian Roberts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAcWM6rnnlA):
  - ~claim: "layers from behind" -
    "structure (inc. cropping & framing) -> value masses ("design") -> actual picture & details fall out from this"
    - structure/cropping&framing: \["what we're attracted to? what grabs our attention? keep it or cut it because distracts?"]
      \["movement of eyesight between main elements; the rest is simple and just supports it"]
    - "focus on big, simple, flat masses of value"
