_(the excerpt below is from a [post I wrote](https://old.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/comments/1icyea9/whats_on_your_mind/ma5x23n/) on reddit)_

> FWIW, one of the many great pieces of advice I encountered was to take a step back and take some time to just think: "what is it that makes it challenging for me?" plus: "what do I want of solo RPGing?" Other than that, maybe three of the most important realizations for me were: for one, that I can always and anyways retcon and reroll whatever I want and however much I want; secondly, that if a piece of story starts shaping in my mind, I can just write it down as/make it be facts in my game and I don't have to roll anything in it; thirdly, inspired by Conan stories and presumed workshop of their author, that I can write disconnected episodes in unclear chronological order, and that it's fine to casually put any story at any stage in a drawer (also metaphorically) and/or butcher and rehash any pieces of it I fancy into another stories at any time now or in the future. Ah, and also the "7 Approaches to Journaling in Solo..." video by Man Alone on youtube.
