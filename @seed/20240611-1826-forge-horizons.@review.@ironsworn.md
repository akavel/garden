# Review: Forge Horizons, by Michael Elliott

_Forge Horizons_ is a supplement for the _Ironsworn: Starforged_ role-playing game.
It is a bundle containing three distinct expansions:
 - rules for episodic gameplay;
 - oracles for planets with a bigger population than in vanilla Starforged (up to "tenths of billions");
 - extra oracle sets for: machines, "supernatural horrors", Precursors (meaning, the Precursors themselves, as creatures).

Personally, all three aspects were what pulled me to buy this product.
Especially the first and the second were something I was already having on my mind
when I accidentally stumbled upon _Forge Horizons_.

## Episodic gameplay

The first section of the book introduces a simple set of rules
on how to start and stop playing _Starforged_ with reduced hassle and overhead.
To me personally, this is the most important and valuable part of this document.
It cuts away a heavy feeling of burden, anxiety and obligation
I was having when I first tried playing vanilla _Starforged_.

_Forge Horizons_ describes how to jumpstart a session of the game
having completed only the Character creation phase,
skipping the overhead of picking the World Truths,
of building a starting Sector,
and even of defining the Background Vow.
Instead, it provides a few simple oracles
for quickly setting up the stage with a randomized inciting incident.
You get some location backdrop,
a bunch of actors,
and a way to spark some interaction growing between them.
This part makes a great use of references to the core _Starforged_ oracles where appropriate.

Finally, having this setup be called _episodic adventures_
puts me in a frame of mind where I find it easier to allow myself
_wilful discontinuity_ in gameplay.
It makes me think of classic science fiction shows like _Star Trek_,
_X-Files_, etc. - in how their episodes were small and loosely connected.
This gives me mental license to not worry
about the burden of consequences of decisions my character makes in the game.
Because - I can always just decide to "end the episode" when I've had enough!
The curtain falls down, credits roll.
And nobody says the next episode has to start immediately afterwards;
to the contrary!
The rules give us a brand new location, a brand new set of actors, a brand new inciting incident.
Our Hero is still alive - so they probably somehow resolved their issues from the end of the last episode.
How did they do that? Who knows! They're a Hero after all - they have their heroic ways!
Maybe we'll learn a bit later, get a peek behind the veil - or maybe not!
For now, we're totally fine to keep it under a convenient shroud of understatement.

## "Ecumenopolis"

The second section of _Forge Horizons_ provides a set of oracles
for populous city-planets.
In my eyes, this helps to make the world of _Starforged_ feel bigger,
and more evocative of the worlds of _Star Wars_ and similar fiction.
The rules for constructing an "ecumenopolis" trigger
when, while rolling for a normal planet, a double is rolled (a "match").

The oracles for a megacity form a functional set/sequence,
in a similar fashion as the ones for a normal planet in base _Starforged_.
I haven't used them yet myself;
after initial glance, they look interesting,
though on the other hand, I feel like they could be slightly richer and bigger.
Also, I'd love if there was some gentle, evocative guidance
on how to actually dive deeper into such cities.
Even a megalopolis will never be completely uniform,
with a variety of very different zones and societies.
Maybe there could be a way to somehow shoehorn
the Settlement oracles from base _Starforged_ to help define areas in an "ecumenopolis"?
Just in case, should I find out I need a bit more,
I can always try pulling some extra oomph from
the free book of _["Stars Without Number"](
https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version)_.
Worst case, the rules for "ecumenopolis"
should work as a really nice mechanism for
smoothly grafting small bits of material from that resource
into _Starforged_.

## Machines, Horrors, and Precursors

The final section of the book is currently the one that
seems somewhat disappointing to me personally.
This opinion may change for the better in the future if I try to actually use them:
the oracles are actually quite rich, big, and interesting.
The one thing I _personally_ found a big let-down, is that
the "supernatural horrors" are assumed to be humanoid.
I'm a huge fan of the lovecraftian style of horror
(a.k.a. ["cosmic horror"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovecraftian_horror)),
where the scary is otherworldly, alien, wildly unfamiliar,
and often humongous in scale.
To me, this feels especially fitting for _space_ adventures,
where the protagonist often encounters cosmic-scale objects -
planets, nebulae, stars, galaxies - and the vastness of space
is their "normal".
In such a setting, I'd love to be helped to generate some
weird monsters of "unspeakable" scale, shape, and composition.
Making all "supernatural horrors" be only mutated humans feels strangely limiting,
reminding me somewhat of slapstick, B-grade movies.
Especially if both the Machines and Precursors oracles actually _do_
include much more varied sizes and forms.
The one though I'm having at this stage,
is that I could try mixing the Creatures oracles from _Starforged_
with some bits and pieces from the ones in _Forge Horizons_ -
the "Supernatural powers" one seems to me the most universal and inspiring in this area.
