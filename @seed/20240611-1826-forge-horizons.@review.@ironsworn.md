# Review: Forge Horizons, by Michael Elliott

_Forge Horizons_ is a supplement for the _Ironsworn: Starforged_ role-playing game.
It is a bundle of three unrelated expansions for the game:
 1. Episodic gameplay.
 2. Planets with a bigger population than in vanilla Starforged (up to "tenths of billions").
 3. Extra oracle sets for: machines, "supernatural horrors", precursors _themselves_ (i.e., precursor creatures).

Personally, all three aspects were what pulled me to buy this product.
Especially the first and the second were something I was already having on my mind
when I accidentally stumbled upon _Forge Horizons_.

## Episodic gameplay.

The first section of the book introduces a simple set of rules
on how to start and stop playing _Starforged_ with reduced hassle and overhead.
To me personally, this is the most important and valuable part of this document.
It cuts away a heavy feeling of burden, anxiety and obligation
I was having when I first tried playing vanilla _Starforged_.

_Forge Horizons_ describes how to jumpstart a session of the game
having completed only the Character creation phase,
skipping the overhead of picking the World Truths,
of building a starting Sector,
and even of defining the Background Vow.
Instead, it provides a few simple oracles
for quickly setting up the stage with a randomized inciting incident.
You get some location backdrop,
a bunch of actors,
and a way to spark some interaction growing between them.
This part makes a great use of references to the core _Starforged_ oracles where appropriate.

Finally, having this setup be called _episodic adventures_
puts me in a frame of mind where I find it easier to allow myself
_wilful discontinuity_ in gameplay.
It makes me think of classic science fiction shows like _Star Trek_,
_X-Files_, etc. - in how their episodes were small and loosely connected.
This gives me mental license to not worry
about the burden of consequences of decisions my character makes in the game.
Because - I can always just decide to "end the episode" when I've had enough!
The curtain falls down, credits roll.
And nobody says the next episode has to start immediately afterwards;
to the contrary!
The rules give us a brand new location, a brand new set of actors, a brand new inciting incident.
Our Hero is still alive - so they probably somehow resolved their issues from the end of the last episode.
How did they do that? Who knows! They're a Hero after all - they have their heroic ways!
Maybe we'll learn a bit later, get a peek behind the veil - or maybe not!
For now, we're totally fine to keep it under a convenient shroud of understatement.
