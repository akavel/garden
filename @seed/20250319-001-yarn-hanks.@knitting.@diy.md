# Unwinding/preparing yarn hanks

Yarn sometimes comes in strange tangled "braids" called "hanks".
Apparently, this is just how yarn is produced,
so for smaller merchants this is easier and cheaper to sell as-is.
From use perspective, reportedly this needs to be converted to
a ball, or a "cake", before knitting,
otherwise it will result in knots etc.

**Step 1:** First thing to do is to remove the "name label/tag",
a piece of paper with the name of the yarn.
Usually, the label should be tied with a completely separate loop of yarn.
It may look the same as the main yarn,
but after following the strand of the loop for a while,
a knot should be possible to find, so that it can be cut off
and removed with the label.

**Step 2:** Now, it should be possible to gradually "untie/unbraid"
the hank into a big loop/circle.

**Step 3:** In the big loop/circle,
more small loops of knotted yarn should be possible to find.
They all need to be removed.
/Ideally, keep them aside for later (?)./
**Attention:** One of the "loops" will be
the "main loop" of the main yarn.
Take a note of it,
and keep it distinctly aside.

/TODO
the yarn in it will typically be knotted into a loop,
i.e. with no "loose ends".
