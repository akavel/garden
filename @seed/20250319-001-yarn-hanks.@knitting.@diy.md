# Unwinding/preparing yarn hanks

Yarn sometimes comes in strange tangled "braids" called "hanks".
Apparently, this is just how yarn is produced,
so for smaller merchants this is easier and cheaper to sell as-is.
From use perspective, reportedly this needs to be converted to
a ball, or a "cake", before knitting,
otherwise it will result in knots etc.

First thing is to even open the hank -
the yarn in it will typically be knotted into a loop,
i.e. with no "loose ends".
