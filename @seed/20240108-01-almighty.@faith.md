# Almighty

[[TODO]]: disclaimer - not necessarily official teaching of the Church; personal exploration/intuition at my current place on spiritual path

For a long time, my notion of God's almightiness
was quite cloudy, subconsciously vaguely akin to
a really powerful deity who can 
move planets when He strains with all His might
and pushes really hard.

Recently, I arrived at a rather different picture,
orders of magnitude more powerful.
I now like to imagine,
that between each [quantum of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronon),
God does, with tender loving care,
with joy and passion of a fascinated hobbyist,
move each and every single physical particle
(each electron, each proton, each quantum of light, ...)
a tiny little bit,
in such a way
that all their movements collectively adhere to the "laws of Physics"
that He himself invented
when He invented the world.
Then, he also
"pushes" each and every kernel of consciousness
a single quantum forward
through time and the material world,
carefully giving those kernels complete freedom
to influence and interact with the particles
and related kernels.

And all of this still using only a small,
fully optional bit of His power.
If the world is really a [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function),
this also shows in my mind
as Him playing the material world's function as a violin.
