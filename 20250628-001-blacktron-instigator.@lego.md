The _Instigator_ is my attempt at disassembling the classic
[6876 Alienator](https://rebrickable.com/sets/6876-1/alienator/)
and building something from it that would be compatible
with the new modular system used in the new
[10355 Blacktron Renegade](https://rebrickable.com/sets/10355-1/blacktron-renegade)
from 2025.
It is very convoluted and hacky, and fragile in places - but hey, it works!!!
If you own the
[40580 Blacktron Cruiser](https://rebrickable.com/sets/40580-1/blacktron-cruiser)
GWP set,
I really recommend building the amazing, free
[MOC-211670 Blacktron BX-9 "Buzzard"](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-211670/Brick_Lizard/blacktron-bx-9-buzzard/)
from
[Brick_Lizard](https://rebrickable.com/users/Brick_Lizard/mocs/),
a reMOC converting it to a design
which is also compatible with the same modular system.

The _Instigator_ has clips both at its front as well as its back.
I like to plug it at the rear of the _Renegade_,
in place of one of its "engine" modules.
I tend to add the smaller "engine" module
from the _BX-9 Buzzard_ MOC at its rear.
I can then build a "satellite"
from the leftover "engine" module
and the "scanner" module,
and just stick it on one of the _Renegade_'s wings.

The _Instigator_ can obviously be also merged with the modules
comprising the small "satellite" of the _Renegade_,
making an arguably adorable "space airplane",
convertible into a "manned, self-propelled satellite".

Finally, it works perfectly fine also as a module of the
[MOC-211670 Blacktron BX-9 "Buzzard"](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-211670/Brick_Lizard/blacktron-bx-9-buzzard/).

I made the instructions for the _Instigator_ available for free,
currently via Rebrickable as
[MOC-226031](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-226031/akavel/blacktron-instigator).
I plan to also put them on this website at some point in the future,
but in the meantime, if you want them without signing up to Rebrickable,
please [message me on Mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@akavel),
and I'll send them to you.
