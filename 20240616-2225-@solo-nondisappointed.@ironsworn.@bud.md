# Not Disappointed

The Golden Rule of solo roleplaying:

_**Don't let a roll make you disappointed or anxious.**_

If you feel that a test roll, or an oracle roll, could make you disappointed or anxious,
_don't make the roll_.
Instead, just go with the result that you feel you enjoy, appreciate, like. 

If you already rolled your dice, and the result makes you disappointed or anxious,
_ignore that roll_.
Either roll again (repeating until not disappointed nor anxious!),
or ignore it completely, and instead go with a result that you feel you enjoy, appreciate, like.

As a corollary,
_only roll if you feel like you'll enjoy the result whatever it is_.
That's your cue on when to roll - if you want to add some chaos,
_and you will not be disappointed by it_.
Still, if you feel that way,
and yet you still discover you got disappointed by the result,
_ignore that roll_ (see the paragraph above).
