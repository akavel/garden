# Go loose

I once found a neat (in my opinion) way to make it easier to write
(and arguably still read easily) one-off JSON payloads.
Part of the trick is to introduce a small local helper type
(for which I hadn't found a better name yet):

```go
type loose map[string]interface{}
json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(loose{
	"foo": "bar",
	"fee": loose{
		"fum": "baz",
	},
})
```

*Update (2023):* As of Go ~1.18+, we can shorten the pattern
by using `any` in place of `interface{}`:

```go
type loose map[string]any
json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(loose{
  "foo": "go1.18+",
  "fee": loose{
    "fum": "baz",
  },
})
```
