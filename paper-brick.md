# A papercraft brick.

Instructions for a cuboid made from a sheet of paper, with no glue used.
The construction seems to quite robustly keep a decent shape,
and to lend itself nicely to some friction-based connectivity by weaving strips of paper under its walls.

The specimens presented below are ~2x2x4cm after folding,
but the idea should work with other dimensions as well (I intend to try 2x2x2cm next).
The paper I used is mostly 190gsm.
