 - **Strong hit:** you have time to "prepare for the journey";
   you are ahead of things and have time to comfortably prepare/already have some advantage.  
   Alternatively: some valuable piece of the path forward is handed to you on a silver plate.
 - **Weak hit:** you have to leave right away;
   you are in haste and kinda entering "carpe diem" with what you have on yourself.  
   Alternatively: you must do some proactive steps to find the path forward.
 - **Miss:** you left yesterday and still have a flat tire;
   you just woke up from a hangover with missing clothes and no wallet.  
   Alternatively: you must do some reactive steps to overcome an active obstacle obstructing the path forward.
