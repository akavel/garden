_"I have to keep reminding myself that the only person I have to entertain in a solo RPG is myself.
Who cares if it's cliche or not a great story or has some flat characters?
Who cares if I spend an entire session ruminating about my PC's morals
or simply talking to myself about the game world instead of pushing the adventure forward?
Those kinds of things may not work in group play, but if they're fun for me, then that's all that really matters."_
