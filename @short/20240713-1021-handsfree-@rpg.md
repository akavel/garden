— a short, free solo RPG for playing purely in your head (no dice required).
The core brilliant innovations:
➊ "Stroke-counting" as a technique for generating a random roll, up to d10:
think of a random word or phrase, then **imagine writing it with a pen/pencil,
and count the number of strokes you make**; for a d10, wrap around back to 1 after reaching 10.
➋ "Wordle" as a technique for generating a random word oracle:
think of a word (can be related to the asked question),
then try to find another word while:
keeping one letter of the original at the same position, and one other letter at a possibly different position.
➌ Borrowed from [Diedream](https://alfredvalley.itch.io/diedream):
"Rapid Associations" as a technique for generating **a random word oracle:**
**quickly think of some related word,**
then again of a word related to that new word,
**repeat in sequence ~four times**
(can count on one hand fingers for a slightly less hands-free experience,
or imagine jumping five pips of a die face for a visual aid: ⚄),
— use the final, ~fifth word.
(TIL: the pattern of five dots arranged as on a die ⚄ is called
[quincunx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx)!)
