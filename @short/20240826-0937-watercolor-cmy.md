Spelled out as _Winsor & Newton_ brand colors, plus their universal pigment names:
☛ _cyan:_ Winsor Blue (green shade) [PB15:3] a.k.a. Phthalocyanine Blue;
☛ _magenta:_ Quinacridone Magenta [PR122];
☛ _yellow:_ Winsor Yellow [PY154] a.k.a. Azo Yellow Light a.k.a. Benzimidazolone Yellow;
☛ _black:_ Payne's Gray [PB15+PBk6+PV19][WN pro Payne's Gray].
 Extra colors for extreme cases - forming a kind of a modified "split primary" palette in the end:
☛ _black:_ "Lunar Black" from Daniel Smith [PBk11];
☛ _green:_ Winsor Green (yellow shade) [PG36];
☛ _violet/purple:_ Winsor Blue (red shade) [PB15:1];
☛ _red:_ Cadmium Red Medium [PR108].
 Note: those are mostly staining colors,
which reportedly has a number of advantages,
but also results in less "typical watercolors texture".
