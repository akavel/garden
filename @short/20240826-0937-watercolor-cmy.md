["A simple watercolor palette for beginners (and experts)"](

Spelled out as _Winsor & Newton_ brand colors, plus their universal pigment names:
☛ _cyan:_ Winsor Blue (green shade) PB15:3 a.k.a. Phthalocyanine Blue;
☛ _magenta:_ Quinacridone Magenta PR122 a.k.a. Azo Yellow Light a.k.a. Benzimidazolone Yellow;
☛ _yellow:_ Winsor Yellow PY154;
☛ _black:_ Payne's Gray PB15 / PBk6 / PV19.
 Extra colors for extreme cases - forming a kind of a modified "split primary" palette in the end:
☛ _black:_ "Lunar Black" from Daniel Smith;
☛ _green:_ Winsor Green (yellow shade) PG36;
☛ _violet/purple:_ Winsor Blue (red shade) PB15:1;
☛ _red:_ Cadmium Red Medium PR108.
 Note: those are mostly staining colors,
which reportedly has a number of advantages,
but also results in less "typical watercolors texture".
