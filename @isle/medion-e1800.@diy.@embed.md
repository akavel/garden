# "Medion Life E1800" teardown

## display

([Question on r/hardwarehacking](https://redd.it/1k8lzl9))

The back side seems to show the following markings:

    R096HQ1501A(L?)
    180913 A2 P(O?)

## pulse sensor

The elastic tape seems to have the markings:

    AB220-SB1024H-HRS33CO FPC-V1.0-20171215

Interestingly, googling for SB1024H led me to
[a document on iget.eu website](https://iget.eu/sites/data/nositelnosti/ce/ce_declaration_of_conformity_fit%20f4%20silver.pdf),
and further googling up an "iGET FIT F4"
seems to show images looking very similar
to how the "Medion Life E1800" looks.
