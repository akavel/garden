## sci-fi

- "[Modular Sci-Fi Buildings](https://youtu.be/uad4OVCMSw8)" from Craft Nicks on youtube -
  white boxes, white cars - with black, hexagonal lines,
  and some transparent blue accents.
  Reminds me of the "Mirror's Edge" videogame.
- "[Mos Cardboard](https://old.reddit.com/r/TerrainBuilding/comments/yq2ueb/with_the_addition_of_my_hangar_mos_cardboard_is/)" -
  normal, gray corrugated cardboard
  with black marker lines,
  alien typography,
  fake glass lines,
  and black inset outlines everywhere.
- [cardboard terrain for Five Parsecs From Home](https://old.reddit.com/r/5Parsecs/comments/18viyf6/cardboard_terrain_for_my_campaign/) -
  inspired by "Mos Cardboard" as linked above,
  with some extra angled lines
  and dots at corners marking rivets in drawn plates of steel.

### characters

- "[Homemade Paper Crew](https://old.reddit.com/r/5Parsecs/comments/1fg5jxj/homemade_paper_crew/)" -
  black sketches on white paper,
  drawn from reference,
  having faces without features (no eyes, mouths, noses).
