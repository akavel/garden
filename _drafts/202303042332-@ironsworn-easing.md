# Easing into playing Ironsworn: Starforged

Some possible ideas and notes for making it easier to get into writing mood
for *"Ironsworn: Starforged":* 

 - a "Soft start" subset of rules: http://redd.it/115xkpe (discussion);
 - see the custom ["Get Unstuck" Session Move](ironsworn-get-unstuck.md);
 - writing in pencil may feel less final & obliging;
 - rerolling oracles multiple times is fine —
   a later result may suddenly trigger some cool idea in your mind;
 - all results are *just prompts* — if e.g. an *"Assault + Sanctuary"*
   oracle result makes you imagine a guy smoking on a graveyard and
   thus you insert a tobacco boss in your story —
   that's the whole point that the roll was for!
 - "Great artists steal";
 - playfully enjoying your mind wandering through some mental associations
   while toying with the game is probably the most important "product"
   that Starforged has a chance to buy you
   (any "written story" being very optional secondary one);
 - experiment (with rules, etc.).
   the more you experiment, the more you will learn
   and increase your understanding and "feel" of the system,
   and how *you personally* most like to use it.
   your preferences and style will differ from others',
   and there is no other way to learn them than through experimenting.
 - "JUST TRY" — acting on this minimal invitation seems to go fine.
